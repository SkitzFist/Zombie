/*
    general:
            System should have an enable and disable mechanic.
    
    Update:
        Two updates. One that updates a chunk
        one that updates a set of entities.

        The chunk gets incremented by a chunkSize each frame. If the
        chunk size is -1, no chunk updates should be done.
        if chunk size is 0 it should update the whole array.
